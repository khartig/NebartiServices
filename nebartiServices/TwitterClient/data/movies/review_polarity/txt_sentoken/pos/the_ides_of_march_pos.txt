Can't decide if I like Ryan better in Ides of March or The Driver. Ides was def the best written movie I've seen all year tho! I ? politics .
Saw such a great movie today ' The Ides of March'. Just riveting! Can't recommend it highly enough!! .
Saw Ides of March today. Powerful once the conflicts begin. Clever ending .
